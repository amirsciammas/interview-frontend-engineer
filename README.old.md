# Frontend Engineer Interview Project

### **High level spec**

Your task is to build a Single Page Application using TypeScript and React that displays data from a public API.

You will use JSONPlaceholder. JSONPlaceholder is a public API which will act as you backend server. You can find all the information about the API over here --> http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

The app should display 2 resources from the API: Users and Posts. 
You should create an app that enable browsing of users and thier posts. 

**You can design it in any way you like, but keep in mind that this is NOT a design task, so keep the UI simple and invest the time in building it properly.**

### **How to share your results?**
- [ ] Clone this repository to your private account.
- [ ] .... develop .....
- [ ] Once you are ready, create a pull request from your private repo and branch to the original repository.


### **Evaluation:**
- [ ] There should be **at least** 1 test written and the README file should include instructions on how to execute it.
- [ ] The React app should build without errors (typically using `npm run build`). If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc). 
- [ ] Everything that you decide to not do due to the limitation of time should be documented in the README.
- [ ] GitHub commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand.
