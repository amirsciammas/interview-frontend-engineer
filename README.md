# Frontend Engineer Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before running the application, install the dependencies by running the command:
### `npm i`

To run the project use the following command: 
### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

To run the tests, use the follwoing command:
### `npm test`

This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Additional Info
As I ran out of time, I have added tests and snapshot tests only for the UserItem and the PostItem Components. With more time, I would have added tests for all components and services, as well as improved the styling and responsiveness.
