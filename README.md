### dependencies
- node v16.x.x (for lastest parcel version; easiest way to manage node versions - nvm or n)
- typescript
- yarn (optional)

### how to run, test and build

- if yarn
```
yarn
yarn start
```

- if npm
```
npm i
npm start
```

- For tests and build you can use ```test``` or ```build``` commands, they should run without any additional setup after installing all dependencies

### additional info

Only few components and store have some test coverage due to simplicity of the task itself. Entire project is done on typescript and being built with parcel (as its a very fast and easy to set up but still highly configurable alternative to webpack). All css modules have type declarations built automatically for easier development.
